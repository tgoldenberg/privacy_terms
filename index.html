        What personal information do we collect from the people that use our app?<br/>
        Basic analytics for app usage.<br/>
When do we collect information? <br/>
We collect information from you when you use our app.<br/>

How do we use your information?<br/>
We may use the information we collect from you when you use the app to improve user experience and usability. We also collect voluntary feedback from users through an email link in the app.<br/>

Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.<br/>

We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.<br/>

All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.<br/.

Third Party Disclosure<br/>
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.<br/>

However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.<br/>

Third party links<br/>
Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.<br/>

Google<br/>
Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6008942<br/>

We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.<br/>

California Online Privacy Protection Act<br/>
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act- caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br/>

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:<br/>
Users can visit our site anonymously<br/>

Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:<br/>
On our Privacy Policy Page<br/>

Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?<br/>
It's also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking<br/>

COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)<br/>
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br/>

We do not specifically market to children under 13.<br/>

Fair Information Practices<br/>
The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br/>

In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br/>
We will notify the users via email<br/>
Within 7 business days<br/>

We will notify the users via in site notification<br/>
